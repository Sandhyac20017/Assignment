HARD 3:
Given an integer n, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.


ALGORITHM:
		1. Input: Take an integer n as input from the user.

		2. Function countDigitOne:

		                                     Initialize count as 0 to store the total count of '1's.
	                                                   Loop from 1 to n.
                    
                            For each number in the loop:
                                                                       Call countOnesInNumber method to count '1's in that number.
                                                                       Add the count of '1's in that number to the overall count. 

                            3.Function countOnesInNumber:

                                                                       Initialize count as 0 to count '1's in a number.
                                                                      While the number (num) is greater than 0:
                                                                      Check each digit of num by taking the remainder when divided by 10 (num % 10).
                                                                      If the digit is equal to 1, increment the count.
                                                                      Divide the number by 10 to remove the last digit.
                                                                      Return the final count of '1's in the given number.


CODE:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class CountDigitOne {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter an integer n: ");
        int n = scanner.nextInt();

       
        int result = countDigitOne(n);
        System.out.println("Output: " + result);
        
       
        scanner.close();
    }

    public static int countDigitOne(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            count += countOnesInNumber(i);
        }
        return count;
    }

   
    private static int countOnesInNumber(int num) {
        int count = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            if (num % 10 == 1) {
                count++;
            }
            num /= 10;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
